Problems to revisit
---
## Couldn't complete myself
  - #4: I did solve this one without looking at the answer, but in nlogn time when
  a log(n) solution was required. It worked but I looked at the solution afterwords to
  see the log(n) technique.
  - #11: tried multiple failed approaches over a few days
  - #31: Looked at related topics dropdown and discussion titles; consulted Skiena (14.4) then Knuth (7.2)
  - #94: Have not ever implemented in-order or post-order DFS for trees, looked them up on Wikipedia
  - #301: Looked at "related topics"
  - #417: Looked at titles, got to a solution that misses only one cell on the last test case but does almost exactly what every other solution does.
  - #560: Looked at unhelpful hint
  - #647: trying to understand DP
  - #750: already had correct algorithm minus one detail.
  - #790: trying to understand DP
  - #894: wasn't familiar enough with array representations of trees
  - #904: didn't look at solution, but checked "related topics" and saw "two pointers"
  - #920: thought the problem required hard combinatorics knowledge (was also a contest problem)
## Contest problems
  I typically review the solutions to contest problems after the contest ends, unless I'm pretty sure I can finish them with more time.

  - #825 (LeetCode Weekly #82)
  - #888 (LeetCode Weekly #98)
  - #898 (LeetCode Weekly #100)
  - #918 (LeetCode Weekly #105)
  - #945 (LeetCode Weekly #112)
  - #947 (LeetCode Weekly #112)
## Can be improved
  - #2 probably has an in-place solution
  - #4 needs to be redone because I did an O(n*log(n)) solution when I should've done an O(log(n)) one
  - #5 has a linear time solution (Manacher's algorithm)
  - #37 took 1.6 seconds and only beat 6% of solutions
  - #76 only beat .99% of solutions
  - #94 can be implemented using threaded BSTs / Morris traversal
  - #130 only beat #17.26% of solutions
  - #133 only beat 16% of solutions
  - #138 has a O(c) space solution
  - #148 is technically not O(c) for space because it uses recursion (thereby relying on the stack)
  - #207 has a solution that does not involve deleting nodes from the graph
  - #238 has a O(c) space solution that I sketched out but didn't implement
  - #329 only ran faster than 2% of solutions despite having an O(mn) solution (best for that problem)
  - #378 was solved with a brute force solution, and has a O(N) solution for an N x M matrix; see [this solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-sorted-matrix/discuss/85170/O(n)-from-paper.-Yes-O(rows).) and [this paper](http://www.cse.yorku.ca/~andy/pubs/X+Y.pdf)
  - #665 has a linear space solution
  - #861 should be redone with goroutines
## Other
  - #489 - started this on a car trip but never got around to finishing it
