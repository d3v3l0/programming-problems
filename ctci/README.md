algorithms
====================
This work-in-progress repository is a collection of all the language-agnostic algorithms and data structures, I have implemented for practice before programming interviews, as well as exercises from popular computer science textbooks. There's no real conventions being followed short of each individual file being a stand-alone problem and solution that can be demonstrated by executing the file.

----
Each file is implemented as a stand-alone script that can run from the Makefile;
just `make <filename_without_extension>`.
