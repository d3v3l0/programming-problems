# programming-problems
Solutions to all of my [LeetCode problems](https://leetcode.com/jsgoller1/), programming competition and interview questions, and some algorithms / data structures implemented for practice. Problems that I need to reattempt are listed in `unsolved/unsolved.md`.

## 2019 Goal
I am attempting to complete a total of 52 programming contests and 300 online problems in 2019 (having already done 120 problems and 8 contests in 2018). I am counting contest problems towards my total problem count.
**Addendum, 1/9/19**: On LeetCode moving forward, I am only picking random new problems or `Hard` ones (except in contests).

### Current progress
#### Problems: 132/420
  - LeetCode: 132
    - Easy: 32
    - Medium: 81
    - Hard: 19
#### Contests (virtual): 8/60
  - LeetCode: #87, #100, #105, #112, #98, #89, #82
  - CodeForces: #511

## How I work on programming problems
I follow a modified form of [Polya's problem solving method](https://math.berkeley.edu/~gmelvin/polya.pdf) that I call `SUPER`; see `SUPER.md` for a full description.

## Struggling with dynamic programming?
Don't fret - dynamic programming is hard to grasp at first, and everyone struggles with it (including me)! I did the following things to learn dynamic programming:
- Watch Steve Skiena's lectures on YouTube about DP from his 2012 algorithms class.
- Read the DP chapter in _The Algorithm Design Manual_.
- Read these Wikipedia articles:
  - [Recursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science))
  - [Dynamic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming)
  - [Optimal substructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_substructure)
  - [Overlapping subproblems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlapping_subproblems)
  - [Longest common subsequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence_problem)
  - [Wagner-Fischer Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagner%E2%80%93Fischer_algorithm)
  - [Partition problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_problem#Pseudo-polynomial_time_algorithm)
  - [Djikstra's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm#Dynamic_programming_perspective)
- Try 20 dynamic programming problems on LeetCode / HackerRank / etc., even if you need to look at the solution; the best advice I ever heard about mastering DP was `don't assume dynamic programming is "too hard" for you until you've solved 20 problems using it`.
- Take Bradfield School of Computer Science's Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures class, if you can.
