## 2018 Goal
One piece of advice I got during Bradfield's algorithms class was `don't assume dynamic programming is "too hard" for you until you've solved 20 problems using it`.
Extending this advice to LeetCode in general, I am attempting to solve a total of 100 LeetCode problems in 2018, 20 of which are DP problems. Current progress:

### General (19/80)
  - Looked at solution for #894
  - #133 was only faster than 16% of solutions and should be optimized
  - A linear space solution exists for #665
  - #861 should be redone with goroutines

### DP: (6/20)
  - Looked at solution for #790
