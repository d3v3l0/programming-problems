# programming-problems
Solutions to all of my programming competition and interview questions, and some algorithms / data structures implemented for practice.

## Contents
- [algos](algos/) - algorithms and data structures implemented for practice / training (mostly from Skiena's _Algorithm Design Manual_, Wikipedia, or research papers)
- [codeforces](codeforces/), [exercism](exercism), [hackerrank](hackerrank/), [leetcode](leetcode/) - solutions to problems from various programming problem websites

## Building
To actually run code in this repo, I use:
- The Dockerized workspace that is automated via the top-level Makefile
- The Makefile system (see below for docs)

## Docs
This repo contains the following docs:
- [SUPER.md](docs/SUPER.md): a modified form of [Polya's problem solving method](https://math.berkeley.edu/~gmelvin/polya.pdf) that I use for programming problems
- [learning-dp.md](docs/learning-dp.md): some general advice for mastering dynamic programming
- [unix-philosophy.md](docs/unix-philosophy.md): a reproduction of Eric S. Raymond's "Unix Philosophy"
- [make-system.md](docs/make-system.md): documentation for this repo's Makefile system

## 2019 Goal
I am attempting to complete a total of 52 programming contests and 300 online problems in 2019 (having already done 120 problems and 8 contests in 2018). I am counting contest problems towards my total problem count.
**Addendum, 1/9/19**: On LeetCode moving forward, I am only picking random new problems or `Hard` ones (except in contests).

### Current progress
#### Problems: 132/420
  - LeetCode: 132
    - Easy: 32
    - Medium: 81
    - Hard: 19
#### Contests (virtual): 8/60
  - LeetCode: #87, #100, #105, #112, #98, #89, #82
  - CodeForces: #511
