# programming-problems
Solutions to LeetCode problems, plus a few other sources; there are way more LeetCode problems than anything else.

## 2018 Goal
One piece of advice I got during Bradfield's algorithms class was `don't assume dynamic programmingis "too hard" for you until you've solved 20 problems using it`. Extending this advice to LeetCode in general, I am attempting to solve a total of 150 LeetCode problems in 2018, a minimum of 20 being DP problems. Current progress:

### General (34/130)
  - Looked at solution for #894
  - #133 was only faster than 16% of solutions and should be optimized
  - #665 has a linear space solution
  - #861 should be redone with goroutines
  - #148 is technically not O(c) for space because it uses recursion (thereby relying on the stack)
  - #378 was solved with a brute force solution, and has a O(N) solution for an N x M matrix; see [this solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-sorted-matrix/discuss/85170/O(n)-from-paper.-Yes-O(rows).) and [this paper](http://www.cse.yorku.ca/~andy/pubs/X+Y.pdf)
  - #2 probably has an in-place solution
  - #207 has a solution that does not involve deleting nodes from the graph

### DP: (11/20; I decided to look at solutions earlier than normal for some of these as I built intuition for DP)
  - Looked at solution for #790
  - Looked at hints in discussion for #918 (contest #105)
  - Had a hint for #647 before looking at solution
