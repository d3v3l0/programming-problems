# Algos
Algorithms and data structures implemented for practice / learning. Much of the code here was written while reading Steve Skiena's _Algorithm Design Manual_.

## What algorithms / data structures do I still need to implement?
Each directory in this repo has a README file associated with it if I've
done any practice on that particular topic.
