Problems I have solved with dynamic programming
---

One piece of advice I got during Bradfield's algorithms class was
`don't assume dynamic programming is "too hard" for you until you've solved 20 problems using it`.
Here are the problems I've solved so far with DP:

1. Word break (#139)
2. Triangle (#120)
3. Decode ways (#91)
4. Maximum subarray (#53)
5. Best time to buy and sell stock II (#122)
