Consider the problem of "finding a needle in a haystack".  In other words, given two strings `needle` and `haystack`, we want to determine whether `needle` occurs as a substring of `haystack`, and if so, where it occurs.

1. Implement a brute-force approach for solving this problem.

- What's the worst-case running time for your implementation?
- What are some "pathological" inputs that would cause such worst-case performance?
- How would your implementation perform on "typical" inputs?

2. What are some specific use-cases where this problem might come up (for example, using Ctrl-F to search through a webpage)?  What are the relevant design constraints in these various cases?  In which cases would a brute-force approach be sufficient?
